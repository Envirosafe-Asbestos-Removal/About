            <p>Eltham and its surrounding areas feature a diverse range of houses, from mid‑century family homes to modern apartments. Our team is skilled at identifying and removing hidden harmful asbestos from lofts, soffits, pipe lagging and garage roofs. We work discreetly and efficiently, leaving your property clean and ready for renovation or sale.

Within Eltham, there are numerous listed buildings that require special care. Our operatives are trained to carry out asbestos management in delicate environments, ensuring listed cornices, mouldings and timber frames remain intact.

Beyond the town centre, the Eltham region encompasses agricultural buildings, barns and stables. We specialise in removing corrugated cement roofing, water tanks and bitumen sheeting from agricultural structures, so you can repurpose them safely.

As a hub for commercial enterprises, Eltham has a variety of commercial properties. We provide tailored solutions for office blocks, retail outlets and industrial estates, including site surveys, encapsulation and licensed removal when required.

Health and safety is at the heart of everything we do. We adhere to UK legislation, including Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012, and provide method statements, risk assessments and waste consignment notes for every job. Our ongoing training ensures we use the latest techniques and equipment to manage dangerous fibres safely.

We are proud to be part of the community in and around Eltham. We recycle and dispose of waste at licensed facilities to minimise environmental impact, and we aim to raise awareness about the dangers of asbestos through local events and partnerships.</p>
