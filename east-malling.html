Health and safety is at the heart of everything we do. We adhere to UK legislation, including Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012, and provide method statements, risk assessments and waste consignment notes for every job. Our ongoing training ensures we use the latest techniques and equipment to manage hazardous asbestos safely.

We are proud to be part of the community in and around East Malling. We recycle and dispose of waste at licensed facilities to minimise environmental impact, and we aim to raise awareness about the dangers of asbestos through local events and partnerships.</p>
