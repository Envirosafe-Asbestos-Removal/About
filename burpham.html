Beyond the town centre, the Burpham region encompasses barns, barns and stables. We specialise in removing corrugated cement roofing, water tanks and bitumen sheeting from agricultural structures, so you can repurpose them safely.

As a hub for shops, Burpham has a variety of commercial properties. We provide tailored solutions for office blocks, retail outlets and industrial estates, including site surveys, encapsulation and licensed removal when required.

Health and safety is at the heart of everything we do. We adhere to UK legislation, including Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012, and provide method statements, risk assessments and waste consignment notes for every job. Our ongoing training ensures we use the latest techniques and equipment to manage hazardous asbestos safely.

We are proud to be part of the community in and around Burpham. We recycle and dispose of waste at licensed facilities to minimise environmental impact, and we aim to raise awareness about the dangers of asbestos through local events and partnerships.</p>
