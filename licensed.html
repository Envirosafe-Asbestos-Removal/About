    <h1>Licensed Asbestos Removal</h1>
    <p>High-risk asbestos materials require a contractor with a full licence from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Examples of licensed work include removing sprayed asbestos coatings, lagging on pipes and boilers, asbestos insulation board (AIB) and loose-fill insulation. These materials tend to produce large amounts of asbestos fibres when disturbed and therefore must be handled by trained, licensed professionals.</p>
    <p>Our experienced team is licensed by the HSE to safely remove high-risk asbestos in compliance with UK regulations. We carry out comprehensive risk assessments and use specialist equipment to ensure fibres do not contaminate your property or the environment. All waste is transported to approved disposal facilities.</p>
    <h2>When is Licensed Removal Required?</h2>

        <li>Sprayed asbestos coatings and decorative finishes</li>
