Our ongoing training ensures we use the latest techniques and equipment to manage dangerous fibres safely.

We are proud to be part of the community in and around Sittingbourne. We recycle and dispose of waste at licensed facilities to minimise environmental impact, and we aim to raise awareness about the dangers of asbestos through local events and partnerships.</p>
