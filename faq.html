    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h2>What is asbestos?</h2>
    <p>Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring fibrous minerals that were widely used in building materials for their heat resistance and strength. Inhalation of asbestos fibres can cause serious lung diseases, which is why its use is now banned in the UK.</p>

    <h2>How do I know if I have asbestos?</h2>
    <p>Properties built before 2000 may contain asbestos in materials such as insulation board, textured coatings, cement sheets and floor tiles. An asbestos survey by qualified professionals is the best way to identify ACMs.</p>

    <h2>Do I always need to remove asbestos?</h2>
    <p>Not necessarily. If asbestos‑containing materials are in good condition and unlikely to be disturbed, they can often remain in place under a management plan. Removal is recommended when materials are damaged, friable or will be affected by refurbishment or demolition.</p>

    <h2>What is the difference between licensed and non‑licensed removal?</h2>
    <p>Licensed removal is required for high‑risk ACMs that release large quantities of fibres when disturbed, such as sprayed coatings and insulation board. Non‑licensed removal covers lower‑risk tasks where exposure is sporadic and low intensity.</p>

    <h2>How much does asbestos removal cost?</h2>
    <p>Costs depend on the type and amount of asbestos, accessibility, and whether the work is licensed. Contact us for a site visit and free quotation.</p>
