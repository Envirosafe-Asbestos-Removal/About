            <p>Acton and its surrounding areas feature a diverse range of residences, from mid‑century family homes to modern apartments. Our team is skilled at identifying and removing hidden fibrous asbestos from lofts, soffits, pipe lagging and garage roofs. We work discreetly and efficiently, leaving your property clean and ready for renovation or sale.</p>

<p>Health and safety is at the heart of everything we do. We adhere to UK legislation, including the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012, and provide method statements, risk assessments and waste consignment notes for every job. Our ongoing training ensures we use the latest techniques and equipment to manage asbestos materials safely.</p>
<p>We are proud to be part of the community in and around Acton. All waste is taken to licensed facilities to minimise environmental impact, and we actively raise awareness about the dangers of asbestos through local events and partnerships.</p>
